## How to Add a New ADR

1. Create a new file: `docs/decisions/NNN-short-title.md`
2. Use the template:
   - **Date** — when the decision was made
   - **Status** — Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
   - **Context** — what problem or need prompted the decision
   - **Decision** — what was chosen
   - **Rationale** — why this approach over alternatives
   - **Consequences** — positive and negative outcomes
3. Update this README's index table
